CPU Flow is a web application designed to simulate and visualize CPU scheduling algorithms, specifically **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)** and **Round Robin (RR)**. It is a handy tool for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to understand how operating systems manage process scheduling.

## Features

- **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) Scheduling:**  
  Simulate process scheduling using the SRT algorithm where the process with the smallest amount of time remaining is selected next.

- **Round Robin (RR) Scheduling:**  
  Explore process scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm with customizable time quantum, ensuring all processes receive equal CPU time.

- **Interactive Interface:**  
  User-friendly and responsive design that clearly displays scheduling outcomes, including Gantt charts and metrics such as waiting time and turnaround time.

- **Web-Based Application:**  
  Accessible directly from your browser with no additional installation required for quick and easy access.

## Live Demo

Experience the application live at [CPU Flow](https://cpu-flow.pages.dev/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Usage

1. **Select the Scheduling Algorithm:**  
   Choose between Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) and Round Robin (RR) from the available options.

2. **Input Process Parameters:**  
   - For SRT: Provide arrival times and burst times for each process.  
   - For RR: Provide arrival times, burst times, and the time quantum.

3. **Run the Simulation:**  
   Click on the "Calculate" button to run the scheduling simulation.

4. **View the Results:**  
   The app will display a Gantt chart along with key metrics such as waiting times and turnaround times, helping you visualize how the processes are managed.
